# Correcting FIP

Through this project, I attempt to improve on Fielder Independent Pitching by modeling earned run average using available sabermetrics to estimate initially ignored effects such as pitcher command and quality of contact. As a byproduct, the model improves on xFIPâ€™s estimate of expected home runs allowed.
